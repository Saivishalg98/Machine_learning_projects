Bank Loan Approval Prediction:

A banking company has the loan application information like the applicant's name, personal details, financial information and requested loan amount and related details and the outcome (whether the application was approved or rejected). Based on the data the task is to train a binary classification model to predict if a loan will get approved or not.
